# Full Goblocks config example with all available block types and options.

# The global section contains global config options.

global:
    # debug is a boolean indicating whether or not to pretty print the json
    # output. Note that this setting requires a restart in order to take
    # effect.
    debug: False
    # refresh_interval is a floating point number indicating the time interval
    # in seconds between when Goblocks sends an updated status line to i3bar.
    # Basically, it controls Goblocks' "frame rate". This value defaults to 1.
    # Note that this value also serves as the default update_interval value for
    # each block.
    refresh_interval: 1

# Below is the per-block configuration. The blocks are defined in a YAML array.

# Each block must have a type field indicating which status indicator to use for
# that block. Different status indicators can have different configuration
# fields.

# Each block may optionally have an update_interval field indicating the time
# interval in seconds between block updates. This is a floating point number,
# allowing for fractions of a second. Note that this interval does not affect
# the refresh rate of Goblocks' output; it only impacts the timing in which a
# block's info gets updated. If update_interval is omitted, then the
# refresh_interval value in the global section is used as the update_interval.

# Each block may optionally have a label field indicating a prefix string to
# prepend to the block's status text.

# If a block has an update_signal field, then that block will be updated and
# Goblocks refreshed when Goblocks receives an RTMIN signal offset by the given
# signal number. See the volume block config.
# For example, if update_signal is 1, then running 'pkill -RTMIN+1 goblocks'
# will cause Goblocks to update the block and refresh.
# The update_signal value must be 1 or greater.

# Blocks may optionally have a color field that specifies the default color of
# the block text, using the 6 digit hex RGB format (e.g. #00ff00 for green).

    # The key block shows statuses of various toggled keys (caps lock, num lock,
